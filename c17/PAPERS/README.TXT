The subfolder PAPERS contains old methodical materials and examples
of programs for template of dynamic arrays (in Russian):
   10           - input data for multiplication of matrixes 10*10
   10.bat       - test of multiplication of matrixes 10*10
   10.res       - sample for comparison with result of multiplication
   10.wrk       - result of multiplication
   Exarray.cpp  - simplified variant of file Exarray.cpp
   Exarray.h    - simplified variant of file Exarray.h
   Matrix.txt   - instruction on preparation of input data
   Matrix1.cpp  - multiplication of matrixes with use of
                  static arrays.
   Matrix2.cpp  - multiplication of matrixes with use of
                  dynamic arrays
   Matrix3.cpp  - multiplication of matrixes with use of
                  dynamic arrays and manual optimization
